    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Here I have listed my top four hobbies</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Reading:</li></h3>
        <p>I am a voracious reader. I read both fiction and non-fiction, everything from short stories to sagas, self-help, and business books. While I like to always have one fiction and one nonfiction book on the go, it’s not uncommon for me to have several books going at once. I read at least a chapter every single night before bed, but on the weekends or a day off, it’s not uncommon for me to spend several more hours reading.</p>
        <h3><li>Traveling:</li></h3>
        <p>My favorite thing to do in my free time is to travel, and I dedicate a lot of time to it. I try to go on one overseas trip every year, but sometimes it is every two years. When I am not traveling overseas, I also like to travel at home and take road trips around my state to see other counties, and on long weekends I often travel to the next state over. I love seeing new places, so if I am not traveling, I am seeking travel inspiration from others on social media, always on the lookout for the best place to go on my next trip.</p>
        <h3><li>Spending Time with My Family:</li></h3>
        <p>My family is easily the most important thing in the world to me, and because of this, the way I prefer to spend my free time is to relax, socialize and interact with them. It might sound cliché of me to say it, but I spend almost all of my free time with my family because it brings me great joy and happiness to be with my children and watch them play and grow.</p>
        <h4><li>Being Creative</li></h4>
        <p>The activity that I enjoy the most is being creative. I have several creative skills, including drawing and painting, but I particularly enjoy graphic design. The ability to make something from my imagination come to life on a screen is very satisfying. I use my skills to take on small jobs for friends and family, and I maintain a portfolio of my work online. I used to create art two to three hours per week, but now that I have the core skill, I just work on projects for enjoyment, usually three or four hours most weeks and any weekend that I have free.</p>
